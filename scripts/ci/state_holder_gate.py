"""Fails on a state holder rebuilt on every pass.

    state_holder_gate.py [<path> ...]

A composable that needs several pieces of state gathers them into a small
`Copy` struct of handles. Written a field at a time it looks right and is not:

    fn rememberWindowState(width: f32, height: f32) -> WindowState {
        WindowState {
            position: rememberMutableStateOf(|| None),
            size: rememberMutableStateOf(move || Size::new(width, height)),
        }
    }

Each field remembers its own handle, so the values survive -- but the struct
around them does not. It is built again on every pass, out of one slot per
field, and the name says `remember` about an object nothing remembers.

Remember the struct itself instead, the way Jetpack Compose does -- one
slot, built once, and later passes read the one that is already there:

    impl WindowState {
        fn new(width: f32, height: f32) -> Self {
            WindowState {
                position: mutableStateOf(None),
                size: mutableStateOf(Size::new(width, height)),
            }
        }
    }

    remember(move || WindowState::new(width, height)).with(|state| *state)

A state made while a `remember` is building its value belongs to that slot
and is released with it, so this neither leaks nor loses anything.

So the test is a struct-literal field initialised straight from a
`remember...` call. A `let` binding is not this shape: a local handle is the
value itself, and nothing is built around it.

This is a copy of `scripts/ci/state_holder_gate.py` in cranpose, because the
two repositories share no tooling to put it in. Change one, change the other.

Prints one line per finding and exits 1 when it finds any.
